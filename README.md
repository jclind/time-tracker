### Reflection

The idea for this project was mainly inspired by my love for data and efficiency tracking. I always like to know how much time I've put into a project and how much each part of that project took. Looking online I couldn't find any simple tracking websites that fitted my needs exacly and weren't paid, so I set off to build my own project that could live up to my expectations.

The first design of the personal time tracker website was a bit clunky as it was it's first design and there were some larger bugs that were difficult to deal with in daily use of the website. So after a couple weeks of personal use, I decided to completely refactor the UI and some of the functionality of the time tracker into what it has become today.

Since this was my first real project with Firebase as a backend, my main challenge in this project was both firebase authentication, and storing/retrieving user data in the cloud. This led me to spend a while researching and studying the firebase documentation and other resources. But eventually I was knowledgeable in firebase to set up both the authentication and storing data in the Firestore Database.

Overall, this project was a great way for me to gain real experience in creating web apps and setting up firebase database communication, and I find this app very useful in my daily work schedule
